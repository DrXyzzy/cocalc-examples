A vector space over an infinite field, like the rationals or the reals, is an infinite set.  No matter how expansive computer memory may seem, it is still finite.  How does Sage fit an infinite set into our finite machines?  The main idea is that a finite-dimensional vector space has a finite set of generators, which we know as a basis.  So Sage really only needs the elements of a basis (two vectors in the previous example) to be able to work with the infinitely many possibilities for elements of the subspace.</p></div>"]},

The reduced row-echelon form of a matrix is unique, so this standard basis allows Sage to recognize when two vector spaces are equal.  Here is an example.</p></div>"]},

Consider creating a vector space from the elements of a finite field of order $7^6=117\\,649\\text{.}$  As elements of a field we know they can be added, so we will <em class=\"emphasis\">define</em> this to be the addition in our vector space.
