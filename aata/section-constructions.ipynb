The statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction. Certainly it is possible to trisect an angle in special cases.  We can construct a $30^\\circ$ angle; hence, it is possible to trisect a $90^\\circ$ angle.
