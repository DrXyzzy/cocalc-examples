The first part of the output is a vector space over the rationals that is isomorphic to <code class=\"code-inline tex2jax_ignore\">F</code>.  The next is a vector space isomorphism (invertible linear transformation) from the provided vector space to the field, while the third is an isomorphism in the opposite direction.  These two isomorphisms can then be used like functions.  Notice that this is different behavior than for <code class=\"code-inline tex2jax_ignore\">.vector_space()</code> applied to finite fields.  Create non-trivial examples that show that these vector space isomorphisms behave as an isomorphism should.

Small examples in Sage (listing all the elements of the group) might aid your intuition—which is why this is a Sage exercise.  Small means $2\\times 2$ and $3\\times 3$ matrices and finite fields with $2,3,4,5$ elements, at most.
