It is possible to create two finite fields of the correct orders for the supefield/subfield realtionship to hold, and to translate between one and the other.  However, in this exercise we will create a subfield of a finite field from scratch.  Since the group of nonzero elements in a finite field is cyclic, the nonzero elements of a subfield will form a subgroup of the cyclic group, and necessarily will be cyclic.</p><p id=\"p-3565\">Create a finite field of order $3^6\\text{.}$  Theory says there is a subfield of order $3^2\\text{,}$ since $2|6\\text{.}$  Determine a generator of multiplicative order $8$ for the nonzero elements of this subfield, and construct these $8$ elements.  Add in the field's zero element to this list.  It should be clear that this set of $9$ elements is closed under multiplication.
