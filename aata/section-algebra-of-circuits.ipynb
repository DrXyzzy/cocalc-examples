Each switch has two possible states: it can be <dfn class=\"terminology\">open</dfn>, and not allow the passage of current through the circuit,  or a it can be <dfn class=\"terminology\">closed</dfn>, and allow the passage of current. These states are mutually exclusive. We require that every switch be in one state or the other—a switch cannot be open and closed at the same time.

In fact, the set of all series-parallel circuits forms a Boolean algebra under the operations of $\\vee$ and $\\wedge\\text{.}$ We can use diagrams to verify the different axioms of a Boolean algebra.

In 1847, he published <em class=\"emphasis\">The Investigation of the Laws of Thought</em>, a book in which he used lattices to formalize logic and the calculus of propositions. Boole believed that mathematics was the study of form rather than of content; that is, he was not so much concerned with what he was calculating as with how he was calculating it.  Boole's work was carried on by his friend Augustus De Morgan (1806–1871).  De Morgan observed  that the principle of duality often held in set theory, as is illustrated by De Morgan's laws for set theory. He believed, as did Boole, that mathematics was the study of symbols and abstract operations.</p></div>"]},
{"cell_type":"markdown", "metadata":{}, "source":["<div class=\"mathbook-content\"><p id=\"p-2993\">Set theory and logic were further advanced by such mathematicians as Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947), Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), and David Hilbert (1862–1943). In <em class=\"emphasis\">Principia Mathematica</em>, Whitehead and Russell attempted to show the connection between mathematics and logic by the deduction of the natural number system from the rules of formal logic. If the natural numbers could be determined from logic itself, then so could much of the rest of existing mathematics.  Hilbert attempted to build up mathematics by using symbolic logic in a way that would prove the consistency of mathematics. His approach was dealt a mortal blow by Kurt Gödel (1906–1978), who proved that there will always be “undecidable” problems in any sufficiently rich axiomatic system; that is, that in any mathematical system of any consequence, there will always be statements that can never be proven either true or false.</p></div>"]},
