They are designed to help you become both more efficient, and more expressive, as you write commands in Sage.  We will have many opportunities to work with cosets and subgroups in the coming chapters.  These exercises do not contain much guidance, and get more challenging as they go.  They are designed to explore, or confirm, results presented in this chapter or earlier chapters.</p></div>"]},

A “single line” means you will have several Sage commands packaged up together in complicated ways.  It does not mean several Sage commands seperated by semi-colons and typed in on a single line.  Be sure include some intermediate steps used in building up your solution, but using smaller ranges of values so as to not overwhelm the reader with lots of output.  This will help you, and the grader of your work, have some confidence that the final version is correct.</p></div>"]},

The <code class=\"code-inline tex2jax_ignore\">srange()</code> command produces Sage integers, which have many more capabilities.  (See the last exercise for an example.)  And remember that a list comprehension is a very compact way to examine many possibilities at once.</p></div>"]},

Provide a single line of Sage code that has all the logic to produce the desired $m$ as its output.
