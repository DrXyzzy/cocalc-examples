We have concentrated on permutation groups because of their concrete feel, with elements written as functions, and because of their thorough implementation in Sage.  Group actions are of great interest when the set they act on is the group itself, and group actions will figure prominently in the proofs of the main results of the next chapter.  However, any time we have a group action on a set, we can view that group as a permutation group on the elements of the set.  So permutation groups are an area of group theory of independent interest, with its own definitions and theorems.</p></div>"]},

In this case, the group is all those permutations that move the solid but leave it filling the same space before the motion (“rigid motions”).</p></div>"]},

A <dfn class=\"terminology\">graph</dfn> is a mathematical object, consisting of vertices and edges, but the only structure is whether or not any given pair of vertices are joined by an edge or not.  The group consists of permutations of vertices that preserve the structure, that is, permutations of vertices that take edges to edges and non-edges to non-edges.  It is very similar to a symmetry group, but there is no notion of any geometric relationships being preserved.</p></div>"]},

Vertices are labeled with strings of three binary digits, $0$ or $1\\text{,}$ and any two vertices are connected by an edge if their strings differ in exactly one location.  We might expect the group of symmetries to have order $24\\text{,}$ rather than order $48\\text{,}$ given its resemblance to a cube (in appearance and in name).  However, when not restricted to rigid motions, we have new permutations that preserve edges.  One in particular is to interchange two “opposite faces.”  Locate two $4$-cycles opposite of each other, listed in the same order:  $000, 010, 110, 100$ and $001, 011, 111, 101\\text{.}$  Notice that each cycle looks very similar, but all the vertices of the first end in a zero and the second cycle has vertices ending in a one.</p></div>"]},

The three vertices of the graph attached directly to $000$ are $100\\text{,}$ $010\\text{,}$ $001\\text{.}$  Any automorphism of the graph that fixes $000$ must then permute the three adjacent vertices.  There are $3!=6$ possible ways to do this, and you can check that each appears in one of the six elements of the stabilizer.
