Fontana was known as Tartaglia (the Stammerer).  As a youth he had suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village. He survived the savage wound, but his speech was permanently impaired.  Tartaglia sent Fior a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of 30 depressed cubics.  Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail.  After much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated Fior, who faded into obscurity.</p></div>"]},

Cardano wrote to Tartaglia, begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic.  Tartaglia refused several of his requests, then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else.

Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia, so he proceeded to publish the solutions in <span class=\"booktitle\">Ars Magna</span> (1545), in which he gave credit to del Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic.  This resulted in a bitter dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia, who published the story of the oath a year later.</p></div>"]}
