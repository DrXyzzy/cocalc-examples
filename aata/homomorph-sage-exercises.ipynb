Evaluate your homomorphism with enough even and odd permutations to be convinced that it is correct.

For each normal subgroup of $D_{20}$ construct a homomorphism from $D_{20}$ to $D_{20}$ that has the normal subgroup as the kernel.  Include in your work verifications that you are creating the desired kernels.  There is a pattern to many of these, but the three of order $20$ will be a challenge.</p>{"cell_type":    "code", "execution_count":null, "metadata":{}, "source":["G = DihedralGroup(20)\n[H.order() for H in G.normal_subgroups()]"], "outputs":[]}</article></div>"]},
