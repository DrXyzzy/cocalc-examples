# Examples for CoCalc

This mainly adds a categorization and meta-description layer on top of this and other example collections.

## Indexing

Call `./index.py` or just do a simple `make` to call that script.

## Datamodel

* Goal: autogenerated JSON for the CoCalc UI, such that user can select templates -- no need to think about the specific representation, only the elements that are the actually moving parts for such a selector.

* YAML Document Types

  * first document: metadata
      * description of tags
      * description of license
      * references: point to another index description file
  * remaining documents are for each indexed entry:
      * Target: Filename/Directory
      * Title
      * Description
      * Tags for categorization
      * license

## Devnotes

If you forgot to `git clone --recursive`:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

If you want to update all submodules in one go, do something like

    git submodule foreach "git checkout master; git pull origin master"
